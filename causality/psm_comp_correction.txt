    mine vs (https://github.com/akelleh/causality/tree/master/causality/estimation)
    t-test code in: compare_psm.py
    modifications: in parametric.py, changed the Logit model (from statsmodels) to the LogisticRegression model (from sklearn)
    2 t-tests were conducted, where each test has a sample size of 100
    dimension of X for each sample data is N x d, where N (number of instance) = 100 and d (feature dimension) = 25
